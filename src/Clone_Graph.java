Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
        1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
        2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
        3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
        4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
